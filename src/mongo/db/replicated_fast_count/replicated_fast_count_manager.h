/**
 * Maintains an in-memory cache of the size and count of all collections.
 *
 * Terminology:
 * The term "fast count" is historical, but should be equivalent to "fast size"
 * and "fast sizecount" to refer to a cached, and therefore "fast", size or count
 * value for a collection.
 *
 *
 * This cache is intended to be accurate, and helps the server avoid expensive
 * collection scans to compute these values. The validate command can check and repair
 * the fast count and size with various flags to the command, like --enforceFastCount.
 *
 * Backing the in-memory cache is a pair of collections used for recovery scenarios.
 *
 * This class and its backing collections are a singleton that creates its internal
 * collection(s) once, the first time a mongod creates its data files. It is assumed
 * these backing collections exist from then on.
 *
 * The backing collections are expected to exist before starting up the ReplicatedFastCountManager
 * background thread.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe, and synchronizes access to the in-memory SizeCount cache,
 * i.e. _metadata.
 *
 * The write path should generally not depend directly on this class, because it relies on
 * the collection write path to persist fast SizeCounts. Instead, operations should
 * interact with this class through UncommittedFastCountChange.
